Full stack test
1. Create a SQL Database and Table to hold the provided MOCK_DATA.
2. Using C# ASP MVC 4.x (not Core), create a list page that reads from that database table and effectively displays all the MOCK_DATA.
3. Use Entity Framework (version 4+) to read/write the database data. Avoid using stored procedures, if you can.
4. Include Create, Edit and Delete buttons on the list page. Have each of them function without reloading the page.

When submitting your code, please include a SQL Script or ".bacpac" file of your entire database schema and data.


Please read the readme file for running the project.
